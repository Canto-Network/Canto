# State

## Chunk

All state transitions of Chunk occur at EndBlock and when an epoch is reached, except when the `MsgLiquidStake` is received by the `msgServer` and there is an empty slot.

```go
type Chunk struct {
  Id uint64 // Unique id increased by 1
  PairedInsuranceId uint64
  UnpairingInsuranceId uint64
  Status ChunkStatus // Status of chunk
}
```

A **chunk** has the following status:

1. `Pairing`: This status indicates that the chunk is ready to be paired with an insurance.
2. `Paired`: A chunk is paired with an insurance that has the lowest fee rate. 
The fee rate is determined by the sum of the insurance fee rate set by the insurance provider and the commission fee rate set by the validator designated by the insurance provider.
3. `Unpairing`: A paired chunk enters this status when paired insurance is started to be withdrawn or 
paired insurance's balance <= 5.75%(double_sign_fraction + down_time_fraction) or the validator becoms invalid(e.g. tombstoned).
4. `UnpairingForUnstaking`: When a delegator (also known as a liquid staker) sends a `MsgLiquidUnstake`, it is queued as a `UnpairingForUnstakingChunkInfo`. 
At the end of the epoch, the actual undelegation is triggered and the chunk enters this state. 
Once the unbonding period is over in next epoch, the staked tokens are returned to the delegator's account and the associated chunk object is removed.

## Insurance

An insurance object is created when Insurance Provider sends valid `MsgInsuranceProvide`.

Most state transition of Insurance occurs at EndBlock and an epoch is reached.

```go
type Insurance struct {
  Id uint64 // Unique id increased by 1
  ValidatorAddress string // An address of Validator
  ProviderAddress string // An address of Insurance Provider
  FeeRate staking_types.Dec // Fee rate
  ChunkId uint64 // Id of the chunk for which the insurance has a duty
  Status InsuranceStatus // Status of Insurance
}
```

An **insurance** has the following status:

1. `Pairing`: This is the default status of an insurance when an insurance provider sends a `MsgInsuranceProvide`. 
This status indicates that the insurance is ready to be paired with a chunk. When an empty slot is available and either `msgLiquidStake` is received or 
`pairing` chunks have been created in the recent epoch, the insurance with the lowest fee will be paired with the chunk. 
Only pairing insurances can be canceled using `MsgCancelInsuranceProvide`.
2. `Paired`: An insurance is paired with a chunk. While the insurance is in this status, it serves as a form of protection for the chunk 
by insuring it against unexpected loss that may occur due to validator slashing. 
This ensures that the chunk remains same size and maximize its staking rewards.
3. `Unpairing`: A paired insurance enters this status when it has no longer has enough balance(5.75% of chunk size tokens) to cover slashing penalties, when the validator is tombstoned, 
or when the paired chunk is started to be undelegated by `MsgLiquidUnstake`. At the next epoch, unpairing will be unpaired or pairing if it is still valid.
4. `UnpairingForWithdrawal`: A paired insurance enters this status when there are queued `WithdrawInsuranceRequest`s created by `MsgWithdrawInsurance` at the epoch.
5. `Unpaired`: `Unpairing` insurances from previous epoch enters this status. `Unpaired` insurance can be withdrawn immediately by `MsgWithdrawInsurance`.

## UnpairingForUnstakingChunkInfo

It is created when msgServer receives `MsgLiquidUnstake` for paired chunk. The actual unbonding is started at **[Handle Queued Liquid Unstakes](06_end_block.md#handle-queued-liquid-unstakes).**

It is removed **[Cover slashing and handle mature unbondings](06_end_block.md#cover-slashing-and-handle-mature-unbondings)* when chunk unbonding is finished.

```go
type UnpairingForUnstakingChunkInfo struct {
  ChunkId uint64 // Which chunk is tracked by this
  DelegatorAddress string // Who requests MsgLiquidUnstake
  // How much lstokens will be burned when unbonding finished
  EscrowedLsTokens sdk.Coin 
}
```

## WithdrawInsuranceRequest

It is created when msgServer got `MsgWithdrawInsurance`

```go
type WithdrawInsuranceRequest struct {
  InsuranceId uint64 // Which insuranced is requested for withdrawal
}
```

This will be consumed at **Handle Queued Withdraw Insurance Requests** when Epoch is reached.

## NetAmountState (in-memory only)

**NetAmount** is the sum of the following items

- reward module accountâ€™s native token(e.g. `acanto`) balance
- sum of all chunk balance
    - The chunk balance will only be as much as the balance accumulated from delegation rewards between epochs. At the end of each epoch, the cumulated chunk balance will be transferred to the reward module account.
    - When insurance is withdrawn and there are no candidate insurances, the chunk balance can be the same as the chunk size in tokens.
- sum of all tokens corresponding delegation shares of paired chunks
    - total amount of native tokens currently delegated
    - may be less than the sum of the delegation shares due to slashing in the calculation
        - This will be an edge case because insurance will cover any penalty.
- sum of all remaining rewards of all chunks delegations
    - not yet claimed native tokens
        - `cumulated delegation rewards x (1 - paired insurance commission rates)`

**MintRate** is the rate that is calculated from total supply of bTokens divided by NetAmount.

- LsTokenTotalSupply / NetAmount

Depending on the equation, the value transformation between native tokens and bTokens can be calculated as follows:

- NativeTokenToLsToken: `nativeTokenAmount * lsTokenTotalSupply / NetAmount` with truncations
- LsTokenToNativeToken: `lsTokenAmount * NetAmount / LsTokenTotalSupply` with truncations

```go
// NetAmountState is type for net amount raw data and mint rate, This is a value
// that depends on the several module state every time, so it is used only for
// calculation and query and is not stored in kv.
type NetAmountState struct {
	// Calculated by (total supply of ls tokens) / NetAmount
	MintRate github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.Dec
